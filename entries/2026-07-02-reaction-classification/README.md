# 2026-07-02 — Reaction classification for the ORD pipeline

## Question

The ORD pipeline currently uses [Rxn-INSIGHT](https://github.com/mrodobbe/Rxn-INSIGHT)
for reaction classification and naming. I'd prefer output that maps onto the **RXNO**
(Name Reaction Ontology) — or NameRxn, but that's proprietary. What would it take to
build a classification system/model that emits RXNO categories? This entry scopes the
landscape: how Rxn-INSIGHT works today, what RXNO/NameRxn/IBM RXN actually are, whether
the newer rxnmapper helps, and the realistic options.

Follow-ups (2026-07-02) widened the scope to two questions that reshaped the answer:
(1) is `RXNMapper_v2` a genuine improvement over the original mapper, and (2) is it
acceptable to target **NameRxn** classes instead of RXNO if a good open model already
exists or enough public labels exist to train one? See the two follow-up sections and the
revised Summary.

## Summary

**RXNO is a vocabulary, not a classifier**, and NameRxn — which emits RXNO IDs directly
alongside its own `N.N.N` codes — is proprietary. My original read was that this left
only a hand-built crosswalk or a NameRxn license. The follow-up research (2026-07-02,
new sections below) found a **better open path**, and it hinges on one verified fact:

**The public Schneider-50k dataset is labeled with *real* NameRxn `N.N.N` codes.** I
fetched the actual file: `schneider50k.tsv`'s `rxn_class` column holds values like
`6.1.5`, `7.1.1`, `1.8.5`, `1.7.9` — genuine NameRxn hierarchical codes, MIT-licensed,
not anonymized integers. Those codes map straight into RXNO. So an open classifier
**already gives you real NameRxn/RXNO labels today** — the catch is a **50-leaf-class
ceiling** (9 of the 10 superclasses, 28 categories, 50 hand-picked leaves). The full
~1000-leaf space has no open dataset; that still needs proprietary NameRxn/Pistachio.

Revised recommendation, by the resolution you actually need:

1. **~50 NameRxn leaf classes is enough → train/run on Schneider-50k (recommended).**
   **SynCat** (2026 SOTA) *ships* a ready-to-run Schneider model (MIT, atom-mapping-free);
   **rxnfp** needs a trivial head trained on its bundled fingerprints (0.994 here) and
   **DRFP** trains its own — all emit real NameRxn `N.N.N` codes. All MIT (benchmarked below). This is a clean jump from today's 10 Rxn-INSIGHT superclasses to
   50 named leaves (plus the superclass/category levels for free by truncating the code),
   and — because the labels *are* NameRxn codes — it **supersedes the original
   "crosswalk Rxn-INSIGHT names → RXNO" idea** for emitting machine-readable classes.
2. **Want fine (~1500-class), open, near-NameRxn resolution → evaluate the Schwaller
   ReactionClassifier** (2026, MIT, arXiv 2607.01061; Rxn-INSIGHT's own author is a
   coauthor). An agentic-LLM pipeline that self-expands a *verified* SMIRKS taxonomy to
   ~1,546 L3 types / 14k classes and matches NameRxn accuracy (~97.7%). It emits its
   **own** dotted codes, not NameRxn's/RXNO IDs, but at near-NameRxn resolution, fully
   open. **Now verified hands-on** (2026-07-02, dedicated section below): the released
   classifier runs **fully offline** (`rdkit`/`torch`/`numpy` — no LLM, no atom mapping)
   and hits **~20x Rxn-INSIGHT's throughput** at *higher* specific-label coverage on 1,572
   ORD reactions. The Gemini layer built the taxonomy offline and is not needed at
   inference. Practical ceiling is its **6,962 trained classes** (not the headline 14k),
   and its codes are its own taxonomy, not RXNO/NameRxn IDs.
3. **Need the full ~1000 NameRxn leaves with exact codes/RXNO IDs → license NameRxn.**
   Still the only turnkey path to complete leaf-level coverage.

The original RXNO-crosswalk-of-Rxn-INSIGHT-names (detailed below, now a **fallback**)
stays useful only if you specifically want to keep Rxn-INSIGHT's human-readable named
reactions; for emitting codes it's dominated by option 1.

On atom mapping: the mapper the question pointed to is **RXNMapper_v2** (a genuine
retrain, not the `rxn4chemistry/rxnmapper` 0.4.x maintenance line) — worth piloting to
improve Rxn-INSIGHT's mappings, but not the lever that unlocks classification (details
below).

## Current state in the ORD codebase

Rxn-INSIGHT is live, in `ord-schema` (not `ord-interface`):

- `ord-schema/ord_schema/orm/reaction_class.py` calls
  `Reaction(smiles, rxn_mapper=RXNMapper()).get_reaction_info()` and returns a
  `(reaction_class, reaction_name)` tuple, e.g. `("C-C Coupling", "Suzuki coupling with
  boronic acids")`.
- Results land in a dedicated `derived.reaction_classes` table (PK `reaction_id`; two
  indexed `Text` columns, `reaction_class` / `reaction_name`), populated during the
  derived post-pass via the optional `--classify_reactions` flag. Rxn-INSIGHT's
  `"OtherReaction"` sentinel is normalized to NULL.
- We already depend on **rxnmapper** transitively, via a `skearnes/Rxn-INSIGHT` fork
  pinned for modern NumPy/SciPy, with `transformers>=4.53,<5` and `setuptools<81` pins
  to keep it importable.
- `ord-interface` and `ord-app` depend on `ord-schema[orm]` but **not**
  `[reaction-class]`, so there's no downstream coupling. Classification is capped at 4
  worker shards because each worker loads a transformer model.

**Structural point that makes this cheap:** the ORD proto has no RXNO/NameRxn field.
Classification is purely derived data, so adding RXNO is a derived-table change, not a
schema change.

## What Rxn-INSIGHT actually is

Correcting a common misattribution: it's **Dobbelaere, Lengyel, Stevens & Van Geem
(Ghent University), *J. Cheminformatics* 16:37 (2024), MIT-licensed** — not a
Schwaller/EPFL project. Its only tie to Schwaller is that it *depends on* rxnmapper. It
is **rule-based, not ML**:

- **Class**: 10 superclasses + "Miscellaneous", assigned by bond-electron-matrix (BE)
  predicates evaluated in a fixed dispatch order (first match wins). The 10 come from
  **Carey et al. 2006** — the same source as NameRxn's level-1 superclasses.
- **Name**: deterministic matching against **528 curated SMIRKS** templates; the first
  template whose predicted product matches the actual product wins, else
  `"OtherReaction"`. No confidence score.
- **Output**: `get_reaction_info()` returns an 18-key dict (`CLASS`, `NAME`,
  `MAPPED_REACTION`, functional groups, rings, scaffold, tag, etc.).
- **Coverage ceiling (on USPTO)**: ~90% get a superclass, only **~51% get a specific
  name**, ~10% fall into Miscellaneous. Entirely dependent on atom-mapping quality — the
  authors flag that BE-matrix classification "becomes inaccurate when the atom mapping
  fails."

The key implication: Rxn-INSIGHT already emits **named reactions** whose vocabulary
overlaps heavily with RXNO's ~500 named reactions, and a superclass scheme that shares
RXNO/NameRxn's lineage. That's exactly what makes a crosswalk viable.

## The RXNO / NameRxn / IBM RXN landscape

- **RXNO (Name Reaction Ontology)** — RSC-maintained (Colin Batchelor), an OBO Foundry
  ontology, **CC-BY 4.0**, distributed as OWL + OBO. IDs like `RXNO:0000006`
  (Diels-Alder). ~500+ reaction classes (OLS reports ~1,019 terms including imports from
  BFO/CHEBI/MOP). It is **named-reaction-dominated**; generic mechanistic transformations
  are delegated to a companion ontology (MOP). **Ships no classifier** — it is a
  controlled vocabulary only. Current loaded release is a somewhat stale 2021-12-16.
- **NameRxn (NextMove Software)** — proprietary rule-based expert system. Given a
  reaction it emits a three-level `superclass.category.name` code **and the matching RXNO
  ID directly** (documented example: `3.1.1 Bromo Suzuki coupling → RXNO:0000140`).
  ~1000+ leaf classes; ships in the HazELNut suite. It **is** the crosswalk the RSC
  ontology relies on in practice.
- **Schneider / USPTO-50k** — the widely used reaction-class benchmarks originate from
  Schneider, Lowe, Sayle & Landrum (*JCIM* 2015) and are **labeled by NameRxn**:
  Schneider-50k carries 50 real NameRxn leaf codes, while the retrosynthesis USPTO-50k
  keeps only the 10 superclasses (table below). The follow-up section draws the (often
  muddled) distinction.
- **IBM RXN's open model = `rxnfp`** (Schwaller et al., *Nat. Mach. Intell.* 3, 2021,
  MIT) — a BERT reaction-fingerprint classifier, ~98% class accuracy, but trained on
  **NameRxn-labeled** Pistachio, so it's an ML surrogate for a proprietary scheme. Its
  one fully open label set, USPTO 1k TPL, uses **template-hash** labels, not RXNO.
  [DRFP](https://github.com/reymond-group/drfp) reaches ~99% of rxnfp's performance
  without atom mapping.

The 10 top-level classes (USPTO-50k counts):

| # | Superclass | Count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Heteroatom alkylation and arylation | 15,204 |
| 2 | Acylation and related processes | 11,972 |
| 3 | C–C bond formation | 5,667 |
| 4 | Heterocycle formation | 909 |
| 5 | Protections | 672 |
| 6 | Deprotections | 8,405 |
| 7 | Reductions | 4,642 |
| 8 | Oxidations | 822 |
| 9 | Functional group interconversion (FGI) | 1,858 |
| 10 | Functional group addition (FGA) | 231 |

**Bottom line for RXNO:** there is no open `(SMILES → RXNO ID)` dataset. Only the
proprietary NameRxn produces RXNO IDs; open models predict into NameRxn-derived or
template-hash label spaces, neither of which is RXNO.

## Atom mapping: two different "new" rxnmappers

Two things both get called "the new rxnmapper"; they are different.

**`rxn4chemistry/rxnmapper` 0.4.3 (2026-02-13), MIT — maintenance, same model.** The
0.4.x line is the **same ALBERT model** (`albert_heads_8_uspto_all_1310k`), not a retrain:

| Version | Date | Notable content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.3.1 | 2024-08-27 | Relaxed torch requirement |
| 0.4.0 | 2024-09-19 | Atom-placeholder (`*`) support; better long-reaction errors |
| 0.4.1 | 2025-03-13 | Dropped Python 3.7 from CI |
| 0.4.2 | 2025-06-01 | Removed the `torch<2.1` cap |
| 0.4.3 | 2026-02-13 | Pinned `transformers>=4.0,<5`; install-doc fixes |

Output unchanged — `{mapped_rxn, confidence}` dicts, `BatchedMapper` for bulk. Worth
upgrading only because older versions don't install cleanly on Python 3.11/3.12 (breakage
in issues #54/#67/#70 — the reason our fork carries pins); it won't improve mappings.

**`yvsgrndjn/RXNMapper_v2` — the actual retrain (what the follow-up pointed to).** A
genuinely reengineered mapper from the **Reymond group (Yves Grandjean)**, coauthors incl.
Schwaller and Genheden (AstraZeneca), MIT. Default model `alberta-uspto-2800k` (~2.8M
USPTO reactions, on HuggingFace); it also bundles the original 2021 model as a selectable
option. It **keeps the original API** (`from rxnmapper import RXNMapper`,
`get_attention_guided_atom_maps`), so it's a drop-in for Rxn-INSIGHT's `RXNMapper()` call
site. Friction:

- **Not on PyPI** — source install only. Dist name is `rxnmapper-v2` but it **imports as
  `rxnmapper`**, so it collides with the pinned `rxnmapper` package; you install it
  *instead of* it, not alongside.
- **Heavier, tighter pins:** `transformers==4.46.3` (exact), `torch>=2.4`, `numpy<1.24`,
  `rdkit>=2024.3.5` — expect resolver work against the fork's environment.
- **No published benchmarks yet.** The cited 2026 ChemRxiv preprint doesn't resolve and
  the README has no accuracy tables. Actively maintained (pushed 2026-06-29).

**Verdict:** RXNMapper_v2 targets Rxn-INSIGHT's documented weak spot (BE-matrix
classification degrades when the mapping fails), so better mappings *plausibly* lift
classification — but the gain is unquantified and the packaging/namespace friction is
real. **Pilot it in an isolated env; don't swap the production dependency until the
preprint lands with numbers (and ideally a PyPI release).** Either way, atom mapping is an
input-quality lever, not what sets the label taxonomy.

## Open NameRxn classification (follow-up 2026-07-02)

The pivotal follow-up question — *can I get NameRxn classes openly, and skip RXNO?* — has
a positive answer, with a hard granularity ceiling.

**What's public, and at what granularity:**

- **Schneider-50k** (`schneider50k.tsv`, in the rxnfp + DRFP repos, MIT) — **50 real
  NameRxn `N.N.N` leaf codes**, 1,000 reactions each (50k total, verified from the file),
  spanning 9 of the 10 superclasses and 28 categories. Human-readable names come from the
  sibling `rxnclass2name.json` (e.g. `3.1.1` = "Bromo Suzuki coupling", `10.1.5` =
  "Wohl-Ziegler bromination"); `rxnclass2id.json` maps the 50 codes to 0–49 for ML. So
  you get **code + name + RXNO-mappable label**, openly.
- **USPTO-50k** (retrosynthesis; retrosim/GLN, MIT) — only the **10 superclass integers**.
  Correction to a common claim: Schneider-50k and this USPTO-50k are **not the same
  reactions relabeled** — they're ~7%-overlapping samples from the same USPTO/Lowe corpus
  under the same NameRxn taxonomy. Use Schneider-50k when you want leaf codes.
- **USPTO-1k-TPL** — 1,000 classes, but **reaction-template hashes, not NameRxn**. Easy to
  mistake for "1000 NameRxn classes"; it isn't.
- **Pistachio / NameRxn** — the full **~967 NameRxn leaf classes** live only here,
  proprietary. No open slice at that granularity.
- **ORD itself** carries no structured NameRxn field (only a free-text `REACTION_TYPE`
  identifier), so there's nothing in our own data to bootstrap-train from.

**Open models that emit these labels:**

| Model | Emits | Classes | License | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **rxnfp** (Schneider classifier) | real NameRxn `N.N.N` | 50 | MIT | pretrained, ~98%, run today |
| **rxnfp** (1k TPL) | template hashes | 1000 | MIT | not NameRxn |
| **DRFP** + your MLP | whatever you train on | 50 (Schneider) | MIT | fingerprint only, 0.956 on Schneider |
| **SynCat** (2026) | NameRxn (Schneider) | 50 | code TBC; paper CC-BY-NC | GINE GNN, ~0.988 SOTA, atom-mapping-free |
| `pingzhili` ChemBERTa (HF) | 10 superclasses | 10 | MIT | 87%, reactant/product input |

**SynCat** ([phuocchung123/SynCat](https://github.com/phuocchung123/SynCat)) is worth a
closer look: it's **atom-mapping-free** (no rxnmapper dependency), and its edge over rxnfp
*grows with granularity* — on 680-class reaction-center clusters it hits 0.982 vs rxnfp's
0.802. It also ships several open finer-grained label schemes beyond the 50 NameRxn codes
— SynTemp reaction-center clusters (143 / 356 / 680 classes) and a 63-class mechanistic
set — though those are cluster/mechanism IDs, not NameRxn/RXNO codes. Flag: the paper is
**CC-BY-NC** (non-commercial); confirm the code/data license before relying on it in ORD.

**The near-NameRxn open outlier — Schwaller ReactionClassifier (2026).** arXiv 2607.01061,
MIT, `schwallergroup/ReactionClassifier`; authors incl. **Maarten Dobbelaere** (the
Rxn-INSIGHT author). An agentic-LLM (Gemini 3) pipeline that writes *verifiable*
generalized SMIRKS rules and self-expands a 68-class seed into **14,073 classes over 7
levels** (19 superclasses, 106 subclasses, ~1,546 L3 types). Deterministic verification: a
rule's template must reproduce the recorded product before a label is emitted. Reported
~97.7% on unseen reactions — matching NameRxn — and expert chemists preferred its labels
over NameRxn (82.6% vs 61.8%). Ships a ~666k-reaction labeled USPTO DB (NameRxn columns
excluded as proprietary). Caveats: its codes are its **own** taxonomy (not NameRxn/RXNO
IDs), OOD coverage on 2025 academic reactions trails NameRxn (~68% vs 89%), and it's a
1-day-old, non-peer-reviewed preprint; the LLM layer needs a Gemini key (the deterministic
classifier + released rules run offline).

**So, does rxnfp "spit out NameRxn classes"?** Its *Schneider* classifier does — real
`N.N.N` codes at 50-leaf granularity. Its 1k-TPL classifier does not. And there are
*enough public labels to train* an open NameRxn classifier only up to ~50 leaf classes;
beyond that the proprietary ceiling holds — unless you accept a self-generated taxonomy
like the ReactionClassifier's.

## Hands-on benchmark: four classifiers — cost, coverage, and names (2026-07-02)

Follow-up prompted by two questions: is ReactionClassifier really offline/cheap, and are the
open **NameRxn-code** classifiers (rxnfp, SynCat) more *useful* than its private taxonomy —
i.e. do they emit recognizable named reactions? Benchmarked all four on the **same 1,572 real
ORD reactions** (sampled from `ord-data`, atom maps stripped to unmapped canonical SMILES;
single CPU process, isolated venv, dev Mac). For the two 50-class models, names come from
NameRxn's `rxnclass2name.json`; the rxnfp head was trained on the bundled Schneider-50k
fingerprints (**0.994** test acc) and SynCat runs its **shipped** `model_schneider.pt`
(index→code map calibrated on Schneider test, **0.976** recovered; paper reports 0.988).
Scripts and a reproduction guide are kept alongside this entry in [`bench/`](bench/).

### It runs fully offline — no LLM at inference

The shipped `classify()` path is:

```text
reaction SMILES
  -> RDKit Morgan diff+product fingerprint (radius 2, 2x2048 -> 4096-dim)
  -> 22 MB MLP gate (predicts 1 of 6,962 classes)
  -> RDKit template matching over the predicted class's tier-3 subtree
  -> emit a label only if a shipped template reproduces the recorded product,
     else abstain and expose an (unverified) neural guess
```

- **Dependencies are only `rdkit`, `torch`, `numpy`.** No `transformers`, no `rxnmapper`,
  no Gemini, no network, **no atom mapping**. The Gemini-3 multi-agent layer wrote the
  taxonomy and SMIRKS rules *offline, once*; it is not in the inference loop (confirmed
  from the repo source — the paper abstract is coy about this).
- **Everything needed ships in the wheel (~35 MB):** the gate `model.pt` (22 MB, trained
  on 628,870 reactions), **54,857 exact `rr0rp1_ring0` templates** across 6,962 classes
  (`class_to_templates.json`, 12.6 MB), and a 14,060-entry `taxonomy.json`.
- **Two caveats.** (1) The full *generalised*-SMIRKS library is **withheld** — only the
  exact templates ship, so the generalized-rule layer can't be reproduced or extended. (2)
  Operational resolution is the **6,962** classes that had training data, not the paper's
  headline 14,073; and the codes are its **own** taxonomy, not NameRxn/RXNO IDs.

### Benchmark: all four on the same 1,572 reactions

| Metric | ReactionClassifier | Rxn-INSIGHT | rxnfp + head | SynCat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Throughput (rxn/s) | 169.8 | 8.6 | **186.1** | 112.1 |
| Median latency | 2.1 ms | 113 ms | 5.1 ms | — (batch 8) |
| Peak RSS / process | 1,380 MB | 461 MB | 622 MB | **367 MB** |
| Label space | 6,962 own | ~528 named / 10 super | 50 NameRxn | 50 NameRxn |
| Names | structured/descriptive | **eponymous** (Buchwald, Suzuki…) | NameRxn (part eponymous) | NameRxn (part eponymous) |
| Abstains? | yes (template-confirm) | partial (`OtherReaction`) | **no** | **no** |
| Atom mapping | no | **yes** (ALBERT) | no (small BERT fp) | no |
| Accuracy | 58.7% confirmed on ORD¹ | 51.4% named on ORD¹ | 0.994 Schneider² | 0.976 / 0.988 Schneider² |
| Extra deps | rdkit, torch, numpy | + transformers, rxnmapper | + transformers (bert_ft) | + torch_geometric |

¹ specific-label rate on the ORD sample (abstention / `OtherReaction` counts against it).
² held-out Schneider-50k accuracy — *not* comparable to the ORD rate; the 50-class models
always emit a label, so they have no ORD "coverage" number.

**Read of it:**

- **Speed splits by architecture, not "ML vs rules."** rxnfp (186) ≈ ReactionClassifier
  (170) > SynCat (112) ≫ Rxn-INSIGHT (8.6). Rxn-INSIGHT is the outlier because it runs the
  **ALBERT atom-mapping transformer per reaction** (its documented weak spot and its heavy
  dependency); everything else skips atom mapping — answering the "heavyweight for ORD-scale"
  worry. Correcting an earlier assumption: rxnfp is **not** transformer-heavy — `bert_ft` is a
  *small* BERT (256-dim, vocab 591), so its fingerprint pass is as cheap as an MLP. SynCat's
  cost is **RDKit featurization**, not the 1.8 MB GNN.
- **Memory: SynCat lightest (367 MB), ReactionClassifier heaviest (1,380 MB).** The RXC bloat
  is RDKit compiling matched SMIRKS into its template cache (tunable `lru_cache`), not a model
  — so the earlier prediction that RXC would be memory-light was wrong; its win is throughput +
  simplicity, and memory *per unit throughput* (one process ≈ 20 Rxn-INSIGHT workers). None
  needs a GPU.
- **Only the "own-taxonomy" models can abstain.** ReactionClassifier withholds a label (and
  flags low confidence) when nothing fits; Rxn-INSIGHT falls back to `OtherReaction`. The
  50-class NameRxn models **cannot** — they force every reaction into one of 50 classes, so
  they are *confidently wrong* on out-of-scope chemistry (the barbituric row below).

### Example outputs (identical input to all four)

| Reaction | ReactionClassifier | Rxn-INSIGHT | rxnfp | SynCat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Amide coupling | `2.1.2.1` 1° amine + acid → 2° amide | Acylation → acid + primary amine to amide | `2.1.2` Carboxylic acid + amine | `2.1.2` Carboxylic acid + amine |
| Suzuki | `3.1.1.1.1` classic Suzuki (aryl Br + boronic acid) | C-C Coupling → **Suzuki** coupling | `3.1.5` Bromo **Suzuki**-type | `3.1.5` Bromo **Suzuki**-type |
| SNAr / N-arylation | `1.3.5.5` SNAr, heteroaryl halide + 2° amine | → **Ullmann-Goldberg** amine | `1.3.7` Chloro N-arylation | `1.3.7` Chloro N-arylation |
| Nitro reduction | `6.1.11.1` nitrobenzene → aniline | Reduction → nitro → amine | `7.1.1` Nitro to amino | `7.1.1` Nitro to amino |
| Boc protection | `2.4.1.3.1.1` carbamate, amine + dicarbonate | Protection → **Boc** w/ Boc anhydride | `5.1.1` **N-Boc** protection | `5.1.1` **N-Boc** protection |
| Ester saponification | `5.1.4.1.1` cleave methyl/ethyl ester | Deprotection → **saponification** | `6.2.1` CO2H-Et deprotection | `6.2.1` CO2H-Et deprotection |
| ORD SNAr amination | `1.3.6.1` amination of heteroaryl halides | → N-arylation (**Buchwald**/Ullmann) | `1.3.7` Chloro N-arylation | `1.3.7` Chloro N-arylation |
| ORD barbituric condensation | **abstains**; guess `2.1.1.12` conf **0.17** | Heterocycle formation → `OtherReaction` | `2.6.1` Ester Schotten-Baumann ✗ | `6.3.7` Methoxy to hydroxy ✗ |

- **rxnfp and SynCat agree on every clean reaction** (both are Schneider-50k models) and give
  standard, **RXNO-mappable** NameRxn codes. They diverge only on the out-of-scope barbituric
  case — where **both are confidently wrong**, in different ways, because neither can abstain.
- **Named reactions / the Buchwald point.** The NameRxn-50 scheme *does* carry eponymous names
  (Suzuki, Sonogashira, Stille, Mitsunobu, Williamson, Schotten-Baumann, Fischer-Speier) — but
  it has **no Buchwald-Hartwig / Ullmann / Heck class**; amine arylations collapse to generic
  "Bromo/Chloro N-arylation." Only **Rxn-INSIGHT** annotates "Buchwald" here (its own
  vocabulary); the discrete Buchwald leaf otherwise lives only in proprietary NameRxn.
- ReactionClassifier lands the **finest, most structured** leaf, but with descriptive not
  eponymous names — and can **disagree on mechanism** (SNAr vs Ullmann-Goldberg for the
  N-arylation), a label-quality question worth an audit.

### rxnfp and SynCat: what actually ships (open question resolved)

- **rxnfp ships *no* ready-to-run 50-class classifier** — only fingerprint models (`bert_ft`)
  and a 1k-TPL classifier. Getting the 50 NameRxn labels means computing `bert_ft`
  fingerprints and **training your own head** (a logistic head over the bundled Schneider
  fingerprints hit **0.994** here — trivial). This resolves the open question from the handoff.
- **SynCat ships a ready-to-run `model_schneider.pt`** (1.8 MB GNN), is **atom-mapping-free**,
  and — importantly — the **code + weights are MIT** (the CC-BY-NC concern flagged earlier was
  the *paper*, not the release). It needs only `torch_geometric` (no torch-scatter build) and
  is the **lightest** of the four. Caveats: it batches internally, its 0.988 headline is
  Schneider-only, and (like rxnfp) it cannot abstain.

### Verdict

Two families, and the choice is about *what a label is for*:

- **Want standard, RXNO-mappable NameRxn codes at ORD scale →** SynCat is the standout (ships
  a model, MIT, atom-mapping-free, lightest RSS, ~112 rxn/s, no head to train); rxnfp is the
  faster alternative if you'll train the trivial head. Both are capped at **50 classes** and
  **cannot abstain** — a real limit on ORD's long tail.
- **Want eponymous, human-facing names or fine resolution →** Rxn-INSIGHT (eponymous, but slow
  and atom-mapping-bound) or ReactionClassifier (6,962 structured leaves, fast, abstains — but
  its own taxonomy). "Buchwald-Hartwig" as a discrete class needs Rxn-INSIGHT or proprietary
  NameRxn.

Still open: a label-**quality** audit at scale (the SNAr-vs-Ullmann-type disagreements), and
whether ORD wants NameRxn/RXNO codes (→ SynCat) or eponymous/fine labels (→ Rxn-INSIGHT /
ReactionClassifier). The granularity decision now has four concrete, measured options.

## Mapping ReactionClassifier → RXNO (scoped and drafted, 2026-07-03)

If ReactionClassifier is the strongest base classifier, can we bolt **RXNO IDs** onto its
output — native fine codes *plus* a standards-compliant ontology label? Scoped it end to end
and built a **draft crosswalk over all 6,926 classes**.

### First, NameRxn ≠ RXNO

- **RXNO** is an open **ontology** (RSC, CC-BY): **653** native reaction terms, opaque IDs
  (`RXNO:0000140`), **named-reaction-dominated**; generic transforms are delegated to the
  companion **MOP** ontology or simply absent.
- **NameRxn** is a proprietary **classifier** that emits `N.N.N` codes *and* the matching RXNO
  ID (`3.1.1 → RXNO:0000140`); it is the practical labeler for RXNO but the two are not
  coextensive (NameRxn ~1,000+ leaves vs RXNO ~653 terms; the code→ID table is proprietary).
- Checked against OLS: Suzuki, Buchwald-Hartwig, Sonogashira, Boc protection, nitro reduction,
  reductive amination, Williamson all have RXNO IDs; **"saponification" has none**;
  **"N-arylation" resolves only to a MOP term**. RXNO covers named reactions richly (it even
  has Buchwald-Hartwig, which the *open 50-class* NameRxn subset lacks) but skips much generic
  chemistry.

### The crosswalk (two passes)

6,926 RXC classes → 653 RXNO terms is many-to-one, bounded by RXNO, not by RXC's count.

| Coverage (of 6,926 classes) | string/synonym match | **LLM pass (47 agents)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| any RXNO id | 51% | 50% |
| **specific** (non-umbrella) | 15% | **40%** |
| RXNO recall | 116/653 | **243/653** |
| **ORD-weighted specific** | 7% | **38%** |

The naive string matcher collapsed onto broad umbrella nodes (1,165 heterocycle classes → the
single "heterocycle synthesis" term); only **7%** of ORD reactions got a *specific* RXNO ID.
The **LLM pass** (one judgment per description, full RXNO vocab in context, `sonnet`) ~5×'d
that to **38%**, more than doubled RXNO recall, and correctly returned **null** for generic
transforms instead of forcing umbrella matches. Sample high-confidence maps: Sonogashira,
Buchwald-Hartwig (recovered even from "N-arylation with aryl sulfonates"), Strecker, Appel,
Gabriel, piperazine/piperidine/pyrrolidine synthesis, Williamson.

### Two ceilings

- **Coverage — RXNO's design.** ~**48%** of ORD reactions have *no* RXNO term (the LLM confirms
  null): generic protections, deprotections, redox, and FGI live in MOP or nowhere. No
  classifier or effort changes this; RXNO is named-reaction-only.
- **Quality — unaudited.** The benchmark examples show the texture: Suzuki → `RXNO:0000140`,
  nitro reduction → `RXNO:0000337`, heteroaryl amination → `RXNO:0000372` (all high confidence)
  — but Boc protection → "N-acylation to carbamate" (medium; a chemist would prefer
  `RXNO:0000079 Boc protection`) and amide coupling → null. ~55% of the maps are low-confidence
  and need review.

### Verdict

RXC→RXNO is the best open path to **fine RXNO IDs on the named-reaction slice** — ~38% of ORD
reactions get a *specific* RXNO named reaction (Suzuki/Buchwald/Sonogashira/…), well beyond the
50-class NameRxn models, and the draft map already exists. But it is **not** a blanket RXNO
labeling: ~half of ORD chemistry has no RXNO term, so the right design is **dual-label** —
always emit RXC's native code, attach the RXNO ID where a high-confidence specific match
exists. Remaining work: chemist review of the medium/low-confidence maps (the Boc-style
near-misses), then decide whether ~38% specific RXNO coverage justifies the crosswalk vs
SynCat's cheaper coarse NameRxn codes. Scripts + the draft map: [`bench/crosswalk/`](bench/crosswalk/).

## Fallback: RXNO crosswalk of Rxn-INSIGHT names

Kept for the case where you retain Rxn-INSIGHT for its human-readable named reactions and
want RXNO IDs bolted on. Now **dominated by the Schneider-50k path** for emitting
machine-readable codes (that path yields real NameRxn codes → RXNO directly, no curation),
but this remains low-effort and additive if you keep Rxn-INSIGHT:

1. **Curation table** — a versioned data file mapping `rxn_insight_name → RXNO:id` (the
   528 SMIRKS names) plus `superclass → RXNO:id` (10 entries). Because both taxonomies
   trace to Carey 2006 and RXNO's ~500 named reactions overlap Rxn-INSIGHT's 528, most
   entries are direct matches. An LLM-assisted first pass against the RXNO OWL, plus
   chemist review, is roughly a day or two. This is the real work — but it's bounded and
   reviewable, not open-ended.
2. **Schema** — add a nullable `reaction_rxno_id` (and optionally a cached `rxno_label`)
   to `derived.reaction_classes`. No proto change.
3. **Population** — extend `classify_reaction_smiles` to look up the RXNO ID from the
   name it already computes. Pure dictionary lookup; no new model call.
4. **Display** — embed RXNO's CC-BY labels/definitions in the UI; link out to OLS.
5. **Honest coverage note** — named reactions get a leaf RXNO ID (~51%), classed-only
   reactions get a coarse superclass RXNO node (~39%), Miscellaneous gets nothing
   (~10%). Document this so downstream users don't overread the labels.

## Next steps

- **Prototype the Schneider-50k path**: run pretrained rxnfp (or train DRFP/SynCat) over a
  sample of our reactions, write the 50 `N.N.N` codes (+ names via `rxnclass2name.json`, +
  RXNO IDs) into a new `derived.reaction_classes` column, and compare labels against the
  current Rxn-INSIGHT output.
- **ReactionClassifier: offline viability and cost now verified** (section above) — runs
  offline, ~20x faster than Rxn-INSIGHT, 58.7% deterministically-confirmed coverage vs
  Rxn-INSIGHT's 51.4% named on 1,572 ORD reactions. Remaining work: a **label-quality
  audit** at scale (do the finer codes agree with Rxn-INSIGHT / chemist judgement, e.g. the
  SNAr-vs-Ullmann disagreement?), and decide whether to **map its codes → RXNO/NameRxn**
  (its taxonomy is its own). If quality holds, it can replace both Rxn-INSIGHT and the
  crosswalk.
- **rxnfp and SynCat benchmarked** (section above) — both emit real NameRxn/RXNO-mappable
  codes; SynCat ships a ready MIT model (atom-mapping-free, lightest RSS, ~112 rxn/s), rxnfp
  needs a trivial head (0.994) and runs ~186 rxn/s. Both cap at 50 classes and can't abstain.
  If ORD wants standard NameRxn codes, **pilot SynCat next**; if it wants eponymous or fine
  labels, that's Rxn-INSIGHT / ReactionClassifier.
- **RXC→RXNO crosswalk drafted** (section above; `bench/crosswalk/`) — LLM pass maps ~38% of
  ORD reactions to a *specific* RXNO named reaction, ~48% have no RXNO term. Remaining: a
  chemist review of the medium/low-confidence maps (e.g. Boc → "N-acylation to carbamate"
  should be `RXNO:0000079`), then decide dual-labeling (native RXC code + RXNO where confident)
  vs the cheaper SynCat NameRxn path.
- **Pick the granularity target** (10 superclasses → 50 leaves → ~6,962 ReactionClassifier
  → full ~967 NameRxn); that choice selects the path. Only the last needs a NameRxn license.
- Pilot **RXNMapper_v2** in an isolated env to see if better mappings lift Rxn-INSIGHT
  classification; keep it out of the production dependency until it has published numbers
  and a PyPI release.
- Fold the `rxn4chemistry/rxnmapper` 0.4.3 pin bump into the fork as routine hygiene.

## For the next session (handoff)

**Where things live.** All repos are siblings under `~/github/ord/`: `ord-schema`
(classification code + ORM), `ord-interface` (search API/UI + local-DB tooling), `ord-app`
(frontend), `ord-data` (datasets), `ord-infrastructure` (Pulumi). Python runs in the
**`ord` conda env** (`~/mambaforge/envs/ord`); its `bin/initdb` and Postgres binaries drive
the local DB, *not* the system PATH.

**How classification runs today.** Install the extra into the env:
`pip install ord-schema[reaction-class]` (pulls the `skearnes/Rxn-INSIGHT` fork pinned at
commit `eb71946`, plus rxnmapper). Then
`python -m ord_schema.orm.scripts.add_datasets --classify_reactions ...` populates
`derived.reaction_classes`. The classifier entry points are `classify_reaction_smiles` and
`update_reaction_classes` in `ord-schema/ord_schema/orm/reaction_class.py`. A local/test
Postgres is built via `setup_test_postgres`
(`ord-interface/ord_interface/client/build_database.py`).

**Resolved (2026-07-02, see hands-on section).** rxnfp ships **only** fingerprint models
(`bert_ft`) + a 1k-TPL classifier — **no** ready-to-run 50-class Schneider checkpoint; a
logistic head on its bundled Schneider fingerprints gives 0.994 and runs ~186 rxn/s.
**SynCat** ships a ready-to-run `model_schneider.pt` (MIT, atom-mapping-free, ~112 rxn/s,
lightest RSS) — the lowest-effort open NameRxn path. Both are capped at 50 classes and
cannot abstain.

**RXNO-mapping caveat — don't assume it's free.** Public Schneider data has the `N.N.N`
codes and names but **not** RXNO IDs. Turning a code into `RXNO:xxxxxxx` needs a crosswalk,
most cheaply by matching the NameRxn class *name* (from `rxnclass2name.json`) against the
RXNO OWL — a small, bounded lookup step, not automatic. Skip it entirely if you only need
NameRxn codes and don't actually need RXNO IDs.

**Decision still open (owner: Steven).** The granularity target — 10 superclasses / 50
NameRxn leaves / ~6,962 (ReactionClassifier) / full ~967 (license NameRxn) — is unmade,
and that choice selects the path. Nothing below the full-967 tier needs a paid license.
